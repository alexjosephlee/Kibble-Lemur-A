                        <h3>
                            <i>A message from the founder.</i>
                        </h3>
                        <p>We need your help to take us to the next level! What is the next level?
                            For one thing, it means applying for and getting grants so we can offer
                            S/N assistance to people who can't afford it for their pets. This effort
                            not only helps that particular family, it helps decrease the number of
                            animals needing homes or possibly ending up as yet another sad statistic.
                            Our problem is that we took the great leap of faith to rent the storefront,
                            but now we have monthly expenses. When an organization applies for grants,
                            they have to show that they can meet their budget with the money they have
                            coming in regularly. Grants are to fund special initiatives, such as S/N
                            campaigns. So what we desperately need is to be able to count on $1000
                            a month EVERY MONTH. Do we have 100 people who could commit to just $10
                            a month? Or 50 people who can commit to $20? We know money is tight for
                            many people, so we are not asking for huge donations. (Although we would
                            never turn them down!) If you have been a supporter, you know how much
                            we have been able to accomplish starting with nothing but a dream and a
                            passion for animals. We want to increase our S/N community outreach because
                            the need is so great and the stakes are so high. Unfixed animals breed
                            death and suffering and it can be prevented! There are many different grant
                            options we can apply for as soon as we can document regular income. Just
                            $10 a month can make a huge difference. Watch our progress on facebook
                            or our website to see the fundraising thermometer rise! The Kibble Kitchen
                            is a 501C(3) not for profit, so all of your donations are tax deductible.
                            Please help us FIX this problem! Click the donate button and use our Paypal
                            donate which will allow you to set up monthly donations to the pantry!</p>

                            of helping those in need. I am a single working person who had 3 dogs.
                            I consider them my kids. Due to many circumstances I ended up adopting
                            my sister’s children, which took a tole on me financially. I did not want
                            to give up my pets (my kids). Times got hard and I just kept praying, about
                            a week or so later I read about the kibble kitchen in the newspaper. It
                            was an answer for my prayers. I know it is temporary assistance, and it
                            sure does help while I look for a 2nd job. I am able to keep my dogs, thanks
                            to the kibble kitchen and all their efforts. Hopefully I will be able to
                            donate back when we get back on our feet. Thank You for ALL you do."</p>
